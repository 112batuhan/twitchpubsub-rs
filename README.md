# twitchpubsub-rs
twitch.tv pubsub client implementation. Only implemented channel rewards so far because that's what i needed in my main project.

I made this for my hobby project. I'm no means a good rust programmer, let alone a good programmer.

If you want something usable. Check out [this repository](https://github.com/Nerixyz/twitch-pubsub-rs)
