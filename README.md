# twitchpubsub-rs
twitch.tv pubsub client implementation. Only implemented channel rewards so far because that's what i needed in my main project.

I made this for my hobby project. I'm no means a good rust programmer, let alone a good programmer. But i believe that this client is usable now. Because of rust compiler, I feel more comfortable sharing this project with others than when I write code with other languages.
